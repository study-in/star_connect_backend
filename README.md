# star_connect_backend
Star Connect Backend is a Node.js backend application featuring JWT-based authentication, modular architecture with controllers, services, and routes, dynamic server-side rendering using EJS, and cloud MongoDB integration via Mongoose. The server conditionally runs over HTTPS if SSL certificates are provided; otherwise, it defaults to HTTP.
